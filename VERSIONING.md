This project follows a MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH versioning system. This allows a user to tell what work they need to do to upgrade

- PATCH: When a patch version is released, there would be no reason not to upgrade. PATCH versions contain only bugfixes e.g. stylesheets won't compile, features are missing by mistake, etc.
- MINOR: Cartographic changes to the style, but no incompatible changes to the vector tile definitions. Updates can be made without recreating vector tiles.
- MAJOR: Incompatible changes to vector tile definitions. Old and new vector tiles may not be compatible with each other.
